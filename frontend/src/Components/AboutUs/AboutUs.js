            The LK Domain Registry was established in 1990. Since its inception, it has served the country not only by providing a professional domain registration service, but also by facilitating development of Internet infrastructure to improve the Internet in Sri Lanka.
            </p>
            <p>
            The LK Domain Registry is the sole administrator for web addresses that end in “.lk” in Sri Lanka. As the national-level domain name, a “.lk” domain provides Sri Lankan organizations and individuals with their unique brand identity on the Internet. We register a wide range of domain names including the top-level domains .lk, .com.lk, .org.lk, .edu.lk, .hotel.lk and .web.lk.
            </p>
            <p>
            In addition to English, domain names can also be registered in the Sinhala and Tamil language top-level domains. Its clientele spans all countries, with a majority of it resident in Sri Lanka.
